# Hello

- How does SRP work?

- Results

- `R` Package

???

Would love if folks in this group would check out the package and give feedback. If useful for the community, I would be happy to make changes and publish a new version on CRAN.

## MRP

1. Fit a multilevel regression model

--

2. Predict each cell

--

3. Poststratify

???

This is the MRP Reading Group, so this slide is just for completeness.

## "Poststratification Is Key"

"...it's not crucial that the $\theta_j$ be estimated using multilevel regression. More generally, we can use any *regularized prediction* method..."

---



- Fundamentally, MRP is an exercise in out-of-sample prediction. 

- So the choice of first-stage model should be evaluated by that metric.

## What Model To Use?


???

There have been a number of methods that have stepped in to fill this space.

## Five Steps of SRP

1. Fit $M$ models to your training data.

2. Obtain out-of-sample predictions for each observation through cross-validation.

3. Select model weights $w$ that minimize cross-validated prediction error.

4. Predictions in each cell are $w_i \hat{y}_i$

5. Poststratify as usual.

## Cross-Validation Step

## Monte Carlo

$$y_i = z_{1i} + z_{2i} + z_{3i} + \theta(D^0_i z_{1i} z_{2i} - D^1_i z_{1i} z_{3i}) + \varepsilon_i$$

--

When $\theta = 0$, MRP and SRP perform equally well.

--

As $\theta$ increases...
