## Abstract

In applied settings, regression discontinuity (RD) designs often suffer from noisy datasets and low power. When combined with a statistical significance filter, this tends to produce exaggerated causal effect estimates, typified by implausibly large slope and/or concavity parameters. In this paper, I illustrate the problem through a Monte Carlo simulation and two empirical illustrations from the published literature. I propose a method for estimating the magnitude of the distortion from the statistical significance filter and modified guidelines for the graphical display of RD results.
