["index.html", "Cost-Benefit Analysis Preface", " Cost-Benefit Analysis Joseph T. Ornstein January 23, 2020 Preface Cost-benefit analysis is a method for measuring the effect of a policy, program, or intervention on social welfare. Its aim is to enumerate—for each member of society—the costs and benefits accruing to that person, and evaluate whether, on net, the benefits outweigh the costs. As you can imagine, this is a difficult task! (And not without its critics.) But when done well, it can be a powerful set of tools for deciding how to do the most good in the world within a given budget constraint. What follows are the collected course notes for my Cost-Benefit Analysis class (Brown School, Washington University in St. Louis, Spring 2020). Please enjoy! "],

I’ve included studies that I think we will find interesting, and I expect that you will approach them with a critical eye, noting where they excel and where they fall short of the best practices we discuss in class. 1.2 The Ten Steps of CBA (What a convenient list! For your final project, this is the exact set of things you’ll be expected to do!) Exercise 1: Today, we’ll walk through each of the ten steps and conduct a ‘mock’ CBA as a class. To start, split into three groups. In each group, pick a policy, project, or program to analyze (if you have an idea for something that would make a good final project, suggest it!) 1.2.1 Explain Purpose Typically the justification for an intervention/policy is some sort of market failure. Will discuss these in great detail in Week 3. Three types: Ex ante CBA Ex post CBA In media res CBA Just Latin for “before”, “after”, and “during”. Exercise 2: Take a moment to consider the purpose of your CBA. Into which of the above categories does it fall? Who is your audience? 1.2.2 Specify Alternatives Always compare alternatives to the status quo (i.e. what would happen if you didn’t implement the policy; not just doing nothing). We will ultimately want to create a table that looks like this (alternatives in the columns, impact categories in the rows), called an impact matrix: Exercise 3: What alternative programs are being considered? 1.2.3 Specify Standing Who matters? (Not plants and animals.) Exercise 4: Take a minute to consider: who should receive standing in our CBA? By what criteria should we exclude individuals’ welfare from our consideration? Regional vs. national perspective. Boardman recommends taking a national perspective as the default. 1.2.4 Identify Impacts Exercise 5: Take ten minutes to identify as many potential costs and benefits for our proposed project as you can. 1.2.5 Predict The Boardman text is actually quite sparse on this really crucial part of a CBA. In Week 5, we’ll discuss: Ensemble estimates Fermi methods Best practices in meta-analysis Exercise 6: For each impact we’ve identified, what are some strategies we could use to predict the impact of the program? 1.2.6 Monetize This is the central conceptual move that CBA makes so that we can compare apples and oranges. For each benefit and cost, we need to convert it to a common scale. In this case, $$$. Broadly speaking, three methods for monetizing impacts: Market Prices (if they exist, this is the easiest) Stated Preferences Revealed Preferences Exercise 7: For each impact we’ve identified, what are some strategies we could use to monetize the impact of the program? 1.2.7 Discount Some benefits and costs accrue immediately, others in the future. Exercise 8: Suppose you could implement a program that costs $10,000 today and yields $11,000 in benefits two years from now. Is it worth it? How would you know? Depends on your discount rate, the extent to which you discount future benefits and costs compared to benefits and costs today. \\(PV = \\frac{V}{(1 + r)^t}\\) 1.2.8 Compute NPV This is just subtraction. Moving on. 1.2.9 Sensitivity Analysis Much more about this in Week 10, but here’s the basic idea: Identify where there is uncertainty in your assumptions. Predictions, parameters, or monetary equivalents What is the distribution of that estimate? Use the distribution as an input in a Monte Carlo analysis Exercise 9: See ‘w1_sensitivityanalysis.xlsx’ to demonstrate an example of a (simple) sensitivity analysis. 1.2.10 Make a Recommendation Three metrics that are typically reported: Net benefits: \\((B-C)\\) Cost-benefit ratio: \\(\\left(\\frac{B}{C}\\right)\\) \\(P(NB &gt; 0)\\) Next week, we’ll discuss why the Boardman book prefers metric number 1 (and 3).

["conceptual-foundations-of-cba.html", "2 Conceptual Foundations of CBA 2.1 CBA as a Framework for Assessing Efficiency 2.2 Some Fundamental Problems 2.3 CBA of the Day 2.4 Alternative Approaches", " 2 Conceptual Foundations of CBA Today’s Goals: Understand what a CBA is and how it aims to increase social welfare. Understand the limitations of CBA and its underlying moral calculus For the final project, be prepared to define the purpose of our CBA (Step 1), specify alternatives (Step 2), assign standing (Step 3), and make a recommendation (Step 10). Discuss our first CBA of the Day (Full Day Kindergarten, WSIPP 2014) Introduce some alternative approaches to conventional CBA. If time remaining, work on problem sets. This week we’ll think deeply about what a cost-benefit analysis is and why we’re doing it. In so doing, we should be well-prepared to complete Steps 1, 2, 3, and 10 in the Boardman Ten Step Process. 2.1 CBA as a Framework for Assessing Efficiency CBA at the individual-level is pretty straightforward (conceptually). Things get tricky when we try to evaluate costs and benefits for society as a whole. 2.1.1 Pareto Efficiency vs. Kaldor-Hicks Efficiency Pareto Improvement: No one is made worse off. At least one person is made better off. Kaldor-Hicks Improvement: Some people may be made worse off. But we could imagine some set of transfers from those made better off to those made worse off so that, post-transfers, no one is worse off (a potential Pareto Improvement). Pareto Efficient: Impossible to help someone without hurting someone else Kaldor-Hicks Efficient: Impossible to help someone without hurting someone else more. Policies that pass a cost benefit analysis are those where the sum of social benefits is greater than the sum of social costs (\\(B&gt;C\\) ). This is, by definition, a Kaldor-Hicks improvement. Exercise 1: Would you rather use Kaldor-Hicks efficiency or Pareto efficiency as our standard for CBA? Why? Pareto efficiency an impossibly high bar. But it does have the nice feature that we don’t have to worry about interpersonal comparisons of utility. Two foundational concepts for when we think about social welfare in a CBA: WTP and opportunity costs. 2.1.2 Willingness To Pay (WTP) They say you can’t compare apples and oranges. Well, in a CBA we have to find some way to do it! The fundamental move in a cost-benefit analysis is to convert social welfare into monetary equivalents. Inverse is “willingness to accept” (WTA): how much would you need to be paid in order to accept the cost of a policy? If you sum up all the WTP and WTA values, the result is the social benefit \\((B)\\) of the program. Exercise 2: What is your WTP for the following goods? One golden delicious apple. A guarantee that you won’t get the flu this season. Unlimited access to Forest Park. 2.1.3 Opportunity Costs Any time you spend resources, there is an opportunity cost associated with that expenditure. Every dollar you spend on Program X is a dollar that couldn’t go to Program Y. (Or a dollar that you couldn’t just give to a random person in need.) The opportunity cost of an expenditure is the foregone benefit that would have come from spending the money on the best possible alternative. Bastiat’s Parable of the Broken Window (1850) Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper, James Goodfellow, when his careless son has happened to break a pane of glass? If you have been present at such a scene, you will most assuredly bear witness to the fact that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty of them, by common consent apparently, offered the unfortunate owner this invariable consolation – “It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken?” Now, this form of condolence contains an entire theory, which it will be well to show up in this simple case, seeing that it is precisely the same as that which, unhappily, regulates the greater part of our economical institutions. Suppose it cost six francs to repair the damage, and you say that the accident brings six francs to the glazier’s trade – that it encourages that trade to the amount of six francs – I grant it; I have not a word to say against it; you reason justly. The glazier comes, performs his task, receives his six francs, rubs his hands, and, in his heart, blesses the careless child. All this is that which is seen. But if, on the other hand, you come to the conclusion, as is too often the case, that it is a good thing to break windows, that it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it, you will oblige me to call out, “Stop there! Your theory is confined to that which is seen; it takes no account of that which is not seen.” It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library. In short, he would have employed his six francs in some way, which this accident has prevented. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window Exercise 3: How would you determine the opportunity costs for the following expenditures? Buying lunch at the cafeteria. Spending three hours each week in this class. Thinking in terms of opportunity costs helps clarify why we ignore sunk costs. A sunk cost (something you already spent money on) by definition has no opportunity cost, because there is no alternative project you could spend the resources on. If you sum up all the opportunity costs of a program, the result is the social cost \\((C)\\). \\(NB = B - C\\) 2.1.4 Net Benefits or Benefit-Cost Ratio? Net benefit is a better way to prioritize projects than benefit-cost ratio, because a ratio is manipuable: - If you categorize something as a “cost averted” rather than a “benefit gained”, you artificially increase your benefit-cost ratio, but net benefit remains the same. Exercise 4: Consider the following “project”. I’m going to go to the grocery store and buy 1 apple and 1 soda. Apples cost $1 and sodas cost $1. I value the apple at $2 and the soda at $1.50. What is the net benefit of my project? What’s the cost-benefit ratio? Suppose I find a coupon laying on the ground: Buy 1 apple get 1 soda FREE! If I categorize the coupon as a cost saved, what’s the new net benefit of the project? What’s the new benefit-cost ratio? If I categorize the coupon as a benefit, what’s the new net benefit for the project? What’s the new benefit-cost ratio? 2.2 Some Fundamental Problems Using WTP as a measure of value is not a trivial decision! There are six broad issues: 2.2.1 Welfare Consequentialism In moral philosophy terms, CBA is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism—we judge whether an action is “good” based solely on its consequences for people’s well-being. Actions that maximum the sum total of well-being are “better” than others. There are, of course, other schools of thought. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics (e.g. Kantianism) argues that motives, not consequences underlie the moral worth of an action. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics (e.g. Aristotleanism or Confucianism) emphasizes neither motives nor consequences, but on cultivating a set of moral virtues. When we do CBA, we are inherently subscribing to a certain set of underlying moral values: (1) that the consequences of an action can be known, (2) that those consequences are what grant the action moral worth, and (3) that improving the well-being of people is our fundamental moral aim. 2.2.2 Arrow’s Theorem Fundamental problem. What does it mean to have a social preference? X = Pizza (12), Y = Tacos (10), Z = Sushi (9) Condorcet criterion (pairwise majorities) does not produce a transitive social ordering. How do you conduct an analysis of social costs and benefits if society doesn’t have clear preferences over policies? Arrow (1951) shows that transitive social choice functions cannot simultaneously be (a) unanimous, (b) democratic, and (c) satisfy independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). So we must make some restrictive assumptions about preferences in order for WTP to always yield a coherent social ordering.1 2.2.3 WTP Depends on Distribution of Wealth Using willingness to pay as a measure of social benefits faces a straightforward problem: rich people are generally willing to pay more for things than poor people. Consider the following two policies: Policy A: Give a rich person a puppy. Policy B: Give a poor person a puppy. CBA will (typically) assign higher net benefits to Policy A, because the rich person would be willing to pay more for the puppy. Or consider a policy that transfers $10 to a rich person at the cost of $9 from a poor person. The latter probably values that money more (higher marginal utility of money), so Kaldor-Hicks improvement fails to increase aggregate utility (unless we actually make the transfers necessary to produce Pareto improvement). Added critique: the concept of Pareto efficiency itself depends on the status quo distribution of wealth. (Note: Kaldor-Hicks does not.) 2.2.4 Whose WTP should be considered (standing)? Some Discussion Questions: Should you include the perspectives of people outside of your jurisdiction? Suppose you’re working for a municipal government. Should you adopt a local perspective, considering only the benefits/costs that accrue to residents of your city? Or a more universalistic perspective? The latter is more valuable. The former is (sadly?) more common. CBA is anthropocentric. We can only compute WTP for people, so only people count. Should we include the costs of environmental damage or animal welfare into our analyses? If so, how? Should we exclude “socially unacceptable preferences”? Who decides what is socially unacceptable? Haiti example: if husbands have negative WTP for programs that save their wives time, should those preferences be given standing in a CBA? Should future generations receive standing? 2.2.5 How can you put a price on some things? Some Discussion Questions: Many CBAs require putting a monetary value on lives saved (the value of a statistical life, VSL). How does that make you feel? What if you need to put a value on unique or sacred things? Are some goods “priceless”? 2.2.6 Does CBA undermine democracy?? Should we be putting technocrats in charge instead of citizens? Boardman has a good counterpoint here. On a day-to-day basis, citizens aren’t actually in charge. There’s a benefit to having public servants consider diffuse costs/benefits rather than the alternative (considering only the concentrated interests of politically influential groups). 2.3 CBA of the Day Full Day Kindergarten (WSIPP, 2014) 2.4 Alternative Approaches If you are ever asked to evaluate a program, there will be powerful interest groups pushing you not to do a CBA. (This is the point that Boardman is making in Section 1.4 about “guardians” and “spenders”). 2.4.1 Budget Impact Analysis Purely looks at revenues and costs. Unconcerned with social benefits more broadly. Hard-nosed way to evaluate projects. Can be very useful to conduct in some cases! If, for instance, a project needs to be revenue-neutral, then it is essential to conduct a BIA in addition to a CBA. The good news is that it requires almost no additional work. You already have all the cost and revenue figures if you’ve done a CBA. 2.4.2 Cost-Effectiveness Analysis If you are unable or unwilling to monetize the benefits of a program, then CEA is for you! The cost effectiveness of a program is its impact divided by its costs. 2.4.3 Multigoal Analysis What if you’re doing a CEA but there are multiple impacts? How do you trade off one versus the other? In a CBA, you do it through monetization. Absent monetization, you need some subjective standard through which to evaluate the (multiple) benefits of your program. See Section 2.5.2 in Boardman for more detail. 2.4.4 Distributionally-Weighted CBA Just like a CBA, except you consider the distribution of benefits and costs as well, by placing weights on the welfare of each group. The choice of weights is, of course, subjective. \\(NB = \\sum \\lambda_i (B_i - C_i)\\) 2.4.5 What To Do? Boardman’s advice is to start with a conventional cost-benefit analysis. That way, if you do conduct an alternative analysis, you can compare the two results and see how sensitive your recommendation is to your choice of assumptions. Namely, we must assume well-behaved utility functions with declining marginal utility that we can aggregate into market demand by summing. Don’t worry too much about this; it’s the technical jargon that underlies the pretty supply and demand figures we’ll look at in Week 3.↩︎ "],
["microeconomic-foundations-of-cba.html", "3 Microeconomic Foundations of CBA 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Some Economics 101 (aka geometry about money) 3.3 CBA of the Day", " 3 Microeconomic Foundations of CBA Today’s Goals: Review Problem Set 1 Econ 101 Crash Course CBA of the Day 3.1 Introduction Why do we need background in Econ 101? Recall goal of CBA: improve allocative efficiency (i.e. resources used in their most productive capacity) Kaldor-Hicks Efficiency vs. Pareto Efficiency We need some theory if we want to evaluate whether a proposed policy will increase efficiency In a perfectly competitive market, allocative efficiency happens automatically Natural, self-interested behavior of consumers and producers will achieve optimal allocation of resources Shortage and surplus are quickly resolved through price adjustments No efficiency grounds for intervention So the typical justification for intervention is a market failure. From a practical standpoint, Econ 101 will help us determine: Whether to include an impact in our CBA How to monetize the impacts we include 3.2 Some Economics 101 (aka geometry about money) Net social benefits: \\(NSB = B - C\\) Only do projects if \\(NSB &gt; 0\\). In CBA we measure benefits \\((B)\\) based on willingness to pay (WTP). This is captured by the behavior of consumers (the demand curve) We measure costs \\((C)\\) based on opportunity cost. This is captured by the behavior of firms (the supply curve) 3.2.1 Demand Curves What is a demand curve? Why does it slope down? Willingness To Pay (WTP) is the curve. Consumer surplus is the area between the price and the curve. What happens to consumer surplus when the price changes? \\(\\Delta CS = Area(Rectangle) + Area(Triangle)\\) \\(\\Delta CS = (P^*-P_1)X^* + \\frac{1}{2}(P^* - P_1)(X_1-X^*) = \\Delta P X^* + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta P \\Delta X\\) (Equation 3.2) 3.2.1.1 Price Elasticity The steepness of the demand curve indicates its responsiveness. Unfortunately we typically don’t know what the demand curve looks like. More likely to know its elasticity. Elasticity: \\(E_d = \\frac{\\%\\Delta X}{\\%\\Delta P} = \\frac{P^*}{X^*}\\frac{\\Delta X}{\\Delta P}\\) Range Category 0 Perfectly inelastic 0.01 - 0.99 Somewhat inelastic 1 Unit Elastic \\(&gt;\\) 1 Elastic Elasticity Knowing the demand elasticity of a good matters, because it affects the change in consumer surplus from a policy: Elastic demand: large changes in Q -&gt; large changes in CS Inelastic demand: no change in Q -&gt; no change in CS Exercise: Is demand for the following goods likely to be highly elastic, somewhat elastic, or inelastic? Apples Salt Gasoline Plug elasticity into the rectangle-triangle equation (3.2), and you get equation (3.4): \\(\\Delta CS = X^*\\Delta P + \\frac{E_dX^*(\\Delta P)^2}{2P^*}\\) First term represents a transfer of surplus. Second term represents a deadweight loss from consumers being priced out (if it’s a price increase). 3.2.1.2 Taxes Suppose we’re the government (or maybe we have a government grant). In either case, our money ultimately derives from taxes. What is the cost of collecting our revenue through taxes? Consider the rectangle-triangle diagram. The price change could represent a tax we placed on that particular market (maybe a sales tax on a good, or an income tax on work hours, or a property tax on land). The rectangle is the tax revenue we actually collect. The triangle is deadweight loss. Excess Tax Burden (aka leakage): \\(\\frac{DWL}{Revenue} = \\frac{E_dt}{2P^*(1+\\Delta X)/X^*} \\approx \\frac{E_dt}{2P^*}\\) Exercise: Will the deadweight loss from taxation be larger or smaller for highly elastic goods? Why? 3.2.2 Supply Curves “Corporations are people, my friend.” -Mitt Romney Firms/businesses/corporations are composed of people, and their welfare is included in a cost-benefit analysis in the same way you would include any other actor with standing. More specifically, if we want to measure the full costs of a policy, we need a full accounting of opportunity costs, what we must give up if we allocate resources towards the policy. Supply curves track the marginal cost of supplying a good. Why supply curves slope up: Producer surplus: Supply Curves: Producer Surplus and Opportunity Cost Exercise: For the following goods, is supply likely to be highly elastic, somewhat elastic, or inelastic? Pencils Farm Land Social Workers (more or less elastic than Corporate Tax Accountants?) 3.2.3 Market Equilibrium If \\(SS = PS + CS\\), then \\(P^*\\) is the price at which social surplus is at its maximum (allocative efficiency). 3.2.4 Government Surplus What happens when we change prices (e.g. a target pricing policy)? Add GS to SS equation above. 3.2.5 Marginal Excess Tax Burden (METB) Marginal Excess Tax Burden (METB): how much it costs to raise a dollar in government revenue. Exercise: Why is the METB of property taxes less than the METB of income taxes? If your program requires an increase in taxes, then our social surplus calculation should reflect the marginal excess tax burden: \\(SS = CS + PS + (1+METB)GS\\) (Note that this is symmetric: a program that increases govt revenues means a decrease in required taxation, so it also gets the multiplier.) 3.3 CBA of the Day TBD "],

Specifically, how do we measure the social value of the output of our programs? And how does that depend on the private market for the good we’re producing? CBA of the Day 4.1 Impact Categories Recall: goal of CBA is allocative efficiency. Maximize \\(NSB = B - C\\) Social Surplus: \\(SS = CS + PS + GS\\) 3 categories for impacts: Output Markets Input Markets Secondary Markets Knowing an impact’s category will help determine whether to include it in our CBA. Output Markets: Where the intervention “takes place” Directly affected by program/project/policy Note: also includes externalities that are “missing” from output markets Input Markets: Factors of production What you must purchase in order to enact your program Secondary Markets: Anything indirectly affected by the project Impacts still add up as before: \\(\\Delta SS = \\Delta SS_{O} + \\Delta SS_I + \\Delta SS_S\\) \\(\\Delta SS_O = \\gamma_g\\Delta R + \\Delta CS_O + \\Delta PS_O\\) \\(\\Delta SS_I = \\gamma_g \\Delta E + \\Delta CS_I + \\Delta PS_I\\) \\(\\Delta SS_S = \\Delta CS_S + \\Delta PS_S\\) Exercise 1: Categorizing Impacts For each project, think of as many potential impacts as you can, and categorize them into (1) output, (2) input, or (3) secondary. MetroLink Expansion Full Day Kindergarten Smallpox Eradication Over the next two weeks, we’ll talk about how to value impacts when market prices are observable. If that’s not the case (as for many programs involving the environment, health, and social services), then we’ll need shadow prices. More on that topic starting in Week 7. 4.2 Efficient Output Markets To begin, suppose that our program adds supply to an area where there is already a private market. Example: In recreation, private campgrounds exist alongside public campgrounds. 4.2.1 No Price Change If our output is small enough that prices don’t change: Ouput Market, No Price Effect Exercise 2: Is the demand curve shown above elastic or inelastic? What happens to social surplus in this case? (Hint: \\(SS = PS + CS + GS\\)) What if we distribute those q’ units for free? Let’s discuss those results. What happened? 4.2.2 Price Change If our project is so large that prices move: Output Market, With Price Effect Exercise 3: What happens to social surplus in this case? Who gains and who loses? What if we distribute those q’ units for free? (Hint: it matters who gets the goods.) Exercise 4: Suppose that, instead of selling output to consumers, our project reduced costs for producers (e.g. deepening a harbor). How would we model that? 4.3 Distorted Output Markets Now we get to the really interesting (and consequential) cases. What if there doesn’t exist an efficient private market for the good you want to provide? This is an appropriate justification for intervention. We’ll discuss four types of market failures. Asymmetric information Externalities Public goods Addictive goods (Boardman also has a section on monopoly power. Explore at your leisure; it may be useful if your program is intervening in a market with a single private producer.) 4.3.1 Asymmetric Information Whenever a seller has access to information unavailable to a buyer, we say the market is characterized by asymmetric information. Exercise 5: What are some examples of markets with asymmetric information? Types of asymmetric information include search costs, experience goods, and post-experience goods. Can model it by drawing two demand curves, one for uninformed consumers and another for informed consumers. When consumers are uninformed, they overpay and overbuy. Asymmetric Information DWL comes from the individuals between \\(Q_i\\) and \\(Q_u\\) who buy a good that they wouldn’t have bought if they were fully informed. If we can intervene, regulate, or provide information for less than the DWL, then net benefits would be positive. 4.3.2 Externalities An externality is a cost or benefit that your actions impose on someone else. Can be positive or negative Can occur in production or consumption Examples: secondhand smoke, pollution from factories Also known as “missing markets”. No private market that sets a price on externalities. (If there were, then they wouldn’t be externalities anymore, because you could buy and sell them like normal goods.) Exercise 6: Think up some examples of positive and negative externalities. NOTE: It is easy to get confused between what is an externality and what is a “secondary effect”. Secondary effects (which we discuss next week) are effects that occur in markets outside of the primary output market. Note the key word market. If the market is “missing”, then it is an externality, not a secondary effect. This will be an important distinction, because as we will learn next week, our default practice will be to ignore secondary effects. And we don’t want to ignore externalities. Practical considerations for CBA: Identify the type of externality (positive or negative) Which side of the market Try to quantify it Tax negative externalities and subsidize positive externalities (“Pigouvian tax/subsidy”). Try to set exactly at external cost. Negative Externality in Production + Pigouvian Tax: Externalities The firm’s marginal cost of producing something (e.g. pollution) is \\(S^*\\), lower than society’s marginal cost \\(S^\\#\\). Note that optimal level of negative externality is not zero. It’s where \\(SMC=SMB\\). The distributional implications of the Pigouvian tax look like this: Positive Externality in Consumption + Pigouvian Subsidy: Consumers buy too little on their own. Need to somehow shift the supply curve so they purchase \\(q_1\\) instead of \\(q_0\\) (or ideally the quantity at the intersection of \\(D_S\\) and \\(S\\); that would completely eliminate DWL). 4.3.3 Public Goods Two characteristics of goods: Excludability: Can you prohibit people from using it? Rivalry: Does one person’s consumption diminish the its value for someone else? Rivalrous Non-Rivalrous Excludable Private Goods Club Goods Non-Excludable Common Pool Resources Public Goods Exercise 7: Think of one good that falls in each category. Why are public goods special cases in CBA? Markets typically do not exist for public goods. Therefore, valuing them is hard. And yet it’s a very common application of CBA, since government is often the only provider. Non-rivalrous goods face the Free Rider Problem: No reason to pay for something if others will Therefore, you understate your true value; if there were a private market you would under-consume It’s basically an extreme version of the positive externality problem above. If I buy a public good, that doesn’t just give you some benefit; it gives you all the benefit. Private WTP might rationally be $0 even though societal benefits are large Estimating the appropriate WTP values through shadow prices is a major challenge for public goods valuation. Let’s put a pin in that for a few weeks. 4.3.4 Addictive Goods In economist-speak, addictive goods exhibit a negative intrapersonal externality. In other words, consuming them today benefits present-day-you, but at some cost to future-you. Can analyze this in a similar fashion to the asymmetric information case; draw an addicted demand curve and a recreational demand curve. Addictive Goods Addicted gamblers buy \\(Q_A\\) units, but would only buy \\(Q_R\\) if they weren’t addicted. Exercise 8: What’s the total deadweight loss from addiction? Several studies on the social cost of addiction have used this approach – estimating demand curves for unaddicted consumers and addicted consumers and computing the deadweight loss. Of course, some studies have taken an alternative approach: 4.4 CBA of the Day TBD "],

Learn how to value spillover effects in secondary markets Discuss readings 5.1 Input Markets Now we focus on the things used in the production/delivery of a program. These are the “supply side” factors. 5.1.1 Review: Opportunity Costs Recall that a CBA measures the opportunity cost of employing these factors. What was the value of their best alternative use? Opportunity Costs Opportunity cost is the area under the supply curve! Exercise 1: For each of the following, write down whether government expenditures accurately estimate, over-estimate, or under-estimate the opportunity cost of inputs. Jurors called for jury duty Land to be converted to a waste facility; currently owned by the government Labor for a reforestation program in a small community with high unemployment Labor of current government employees who are required to administer a program Concrete previously poured as part of a bridge foundation NOTE: Why did we do this exercise? Because data on expenditures are the most readily available measure of costs, and if we are using those measures, we need to be sure that they are adequately capturing the true social costs of our program! Let’s break these down into categories of inputs… 5.1.2 Efficient Markets First, suppose we are buying our inputs from an efficient market (i.e. no distortions)… 5.1.2.1 The Ideal Case (Perfectly Elastic Supply) Figure 6.1: Supply and Demand in Efficient Market; No Shift In Prices Remember: \\(\\Delta SS = \\Delta CS + \\Delta PS + \\Delta GS\\) In this case, no change in \\(CS\\) or \\(PS\\). The only thing that changes is \\(GS\\), so \\(\\Delta SS = \\Delta GS\\). Key Result: When you buy your inputs from an efficient market, and your purchases are too small to affect the price, you may use expenditures as your measure of social cost. 5.1.2.2 The Less-Than-Ideal Case (Price Effects) Exercise 2: Draw a standard supply and demand diagram with upward sloping supply and downward sloping demand curves. Suppose we buy \\(q’\\) units. What happens to the demand curve? What is the new price? What happens to consumer surplus (\\(\\Delta CS\\))? What happens to producer surplus (\\(\\Delta PS\\))? How much do we pay (\\(\\Delta GS\\))? Add up 4-6 to get the change in social surplus. What’s the difference between \\(\\Delta SS\\) and budgetary expenditures? Figure 6.3: Opportunity Costs with Price Effects This is some of the gnarliest geometry we’ve yet come across. The following table helps with the accounting: Table 6.1: Adding Up Welfare Effects Key Result: When your project is so big that you bid up the price of inputs, budgetary expenditures overstate the social cost of the project. (It would be a conservative approximation.) 5.1.3 Distorted Markets Now, suppose you’re buying your inputs from a market that is distorted in some way… 5.1.3.1 Below Cost Inputs e.g. jurors not compensated for their time. Exercise 3: Can you think of other examples of below cost inputs? When we use below cost inputs, we can’t rely on market prices, so we need a shadow price to estimate the true opportunity cost. More on that in two weeks. 5.1.3.2 Unemployed Workers Exercise 4: Why do we consider the wages we pay a social cost rather than a social benefit? Don’t the workers we employ have standing in our CBA? In a full-employment economy, the wages we pay labor aren’t considered a social benefit, because absent the program they would be no worse off. If they weren’t working for us, they would be working somewhere else! This calculus changes somewhat if the unemployment rate is high. Then we may be employing workers who would otherwise be out of a job. 5.1.3.2.1 So What Do We Do? Boardman describes 5 different options and recommends 2. Use budgetary expenditures as an upper bound. Why an upper bound? Because we care about their welfare! Absent the program, many of them would have been unemployed or forced to accept a job at a lower wage. Use (budgetary expenditure) / 2 as a lower bound. Why? Note that the opportunity cost of an unemployed worker is not $0. Leisure is valuable; working at home is valuable; childcare is valuable. Each worker has some reservation wage, the lowest wage they will accept to take a job. What are some reasonable ranges for reservation wage? Figure 6.5 Demonstrates that 1/2 is a good lower bound (it assumes a reservation wage of zero). 5.1.3.3 Rural-Urban Migration and Monopoly Purchases These are really niche cases. If you think that your program would induce substantial rural-to-urban migration in a developing country or you plan on purchasing a large amount of inputs from a monopoly provider, consult the relevant Boardman sections and I’m happy to answer questions in person. 5.1.3.4 Supply is Taxed or Subsidized Taxes artificially increase expenditures (budgetary expenditures overestimate social costs) Subsidies artificially decrease expenditures (budgetary expenditures underestimate social costs) 5.1.3.5 Externalities in Supply Exercise 5: Remind me what externalities are? Name an example of a positive externality in an input market. Name an example of a negative externality in a factor market. Positive externality \\(SMC &lt; PMC\\) Thus, budgetary expenditures overestimate opportunity costs Negative externality \\(SMC &gt; PMC\\) Thus, budgetary expenditures underestimate opportunity costs General Rule: Opportunity Cost = Direct Expenditures \\(+\\Delta SS\\) in the factor market 5.1.4 What Have We Learned? Efficient Markets? Program Causes Price Change? Okay to Use Expenditures? Yes No Yes Yes Yes Expenditures overstate opportunity costs No Yes or No Expenditures may overstate or understate opportunity costs 5.2 Secondary Markets The primary output market is the one that the policy/program is targeting. But there may be secondary effects in other markets. Practically speaking, which of these secondary effects to we need to measure and include in our CBA? There is good news! In this section we’ll show that — so long as secondary markets are undistorted — we should ignore them our CBA. Including them is actually a form of double counting. Why do we get secondary market effects? Substitutes and complements. Substitutes: A good you consume instead of another good Program may cause lower consumption of substitute goods Complements: A good you consume together with another good Program may cause higher consumption of complementary goods Exercise 6: Name some examples of substitute goods. Name some examples of complementary goods. Just like with input markets, we can categorize policy impacts on secondary markets: 5.2.1 No Price Effects Figure 7.1: Primary and Secondary markets Key Result: If prices don’t change in the secondary market, ignore those impacts! There is no change in consumer welfare absent price changes; all changes in surplus are fully captured by the primary market analysis. 5.2.2 Price Effects Figure 7.2: Primary and Secondary Markets w/ price changes This shows that: Demand, as typically measured, reflects the change in both markets. Cancels out on average Key Result: Even if there are price changes, we can still ignore secondary markets if they are efficient. Any price changes in the primary market already incorporate information about price changes in the secondary market. So the most important consideration is whether the secondary market is efficient. 5.2.3 Distorted Secondary Markets In distorted markets, potential changes in surplus are not automatically reflected in the primary market. But… Measurement typically quite difficult Effects are often quite small Still good to identify and mention distorted secondary market effects in your CBA, even if you can’t quantify them Two examples of distortions: Externalities in secondary markets. Fishing equipment has lead sinkers which poisons the lake More cars means more traffic congestion Taxes in secondary markets See Figure 7.4 if you want a deeper dive into how taxes in substitute markets diminish the METB of taxes in your primary market. But we won’t go into detail about this. Despite all these caveats, Boardman still recommends ignoring secondary markets. “Fortunately, price changes in most secondary markets are likely to be small. Most pairs of goods are neither strong complements nor strong substitutes…Thus, even when secondary markets are distorted, ignoring these markets may result in relatively little bias to CBA.” 5.2.4 EIA and Multiplier Effects Economic Impact Analysis (EIA) is a narrow version of CBA, focused primarily on secondary market and cash flow. Frequently employed to analysis local development projects, like sports stadiums. Economists and CBA proponents tend to view EIA quite negatively, and EIA reports often violate good principles of CBA. A few reasons why: In undistorted markets, no need to measure secondary effects. Fully captured in the primary market. “Multiplier Effects” typically pertain to limited geographic areas (standing) When standing is considered more broadly, these are just transfers Welfare of non-residents is typically ignored Increased demand for local goods/services does not improve firms unless prices rise Multiplier effects are often overstated, unless all firms are truly locally owned Chain stores don’t distribute all their profits locally The exception is if there are distortions in the secondary market: Very high local unemployment Idle resources (e.g. old mills) Externalities in the secondary market Other barriers to resource mobility (e.g. legal or political restrictions) 5.3 Putting it All Together Exercise 7 (Boardman Exhibit 7.2): Consider a hypothetical street-widening project. What should we include in the CBA? (For each impact, determine whether it is in a primary, input, or secondary market. Is that market efficient or distorted?) Increased traffic causes vibrations that crack the walls of adjacent houses. Increased profits from selling gasoline on the route. Property values of gas stations would increase. Traffic on adjacent streets would decline. Air pollution along the route would increase. Increased auto traffic would require more police officers. More motorists, more traffic violations, more ticket revenue. Fewer people would ride buses; bus company would lay off 10 drivers. 5.4 CBA of the Day TBD "],
