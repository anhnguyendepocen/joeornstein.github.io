The following post is for my future reference on how to embed things like shiny, slides, and tweets into blog posts. Observe, if you will, that we can embed a shiny dashboard into a static website with RMarkdown. Thanks to [Yang Liu](https://liuyanguu.github.io/post/2019/02/24/shiny-in-blogdown/#my-shiny-app-example)!


```{r embed shiny, echo=T}
knitr::include_app("https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov_tracker/?_ga=2.126674445.1246084674.1588877732-1324960155.1586370896", height = "600px")
```

It also works for slides:

```{r embed slides, echo=T}
knitr::include_url('https://timmastny.rbind.io/slides/first_presentation#2')
```
