The [Friendship Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox) states that, on average, your friends have more friends than you do. (It's not your fault. It's just a property of connected networks.) Note that in the network below only agent 3 is more popular than his friends.

```{r plot graph, echo = FALSE}
plot(g)
```

The epidemiological corollary to this rule is that *your contacts have more contacts than you*. We can use this fact to help identify and isolate "super-spreaders" and maximize the effectiveness of the tests we have available.[^christakis-fowler]

## Model Assumptions

Consider an agent-based [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model) with the following assumptions:

1. $R_0 = 2.5$ (i.e., in the absence of intervention, we expect each infected person to infect 2.5 others before recovering).
2. Infections last 10 days.
3. There is significant asymptomatic and/or presymptomatic spread, so we cannot rely on testing symptomatic individuals and must broadly test asymptomatics.
4. 1000 agents with contacts defined by a network. One of two node degree distributions:
 - Node degree distributed Gaussian ~ $\mathcal{N}(12, 2.5)$
 - Node degree distributed lognormal with mean 12 and SD 10.

## Results


```{R Model Setup, include = TRUE}

library(igraph) # package for creating networks

```


If the degree distribution of the contact network is normally distributed, then the most connected individuals are not *that* much more popular than the least connected individuals. In this universe, targeting contacts does not offer a significant improvement over targeting randomly.

But suppose (as is typically the case) that the degree distribution is heavy-tailed. Most agents have relatively few contacts each day, but some agents have an enormous number of contacts. In this universe, you can suppress the epidemic with significantly fewer tests per day if you target contacts rather than targeting randomly.

In summary, if you're considering mass testing as a response to an epidemic, there is no advantage to randomly allocating tests. You can always do at least as well by allocating tests to contacts.
