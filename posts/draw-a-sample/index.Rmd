I wanted to let my students play around with drawing a random sample from a population --- so that they could explore ideas like the Central Limit Theorem, how often a certain low-prevalence virus will show up in a randomly drawn class of size $N$, etc. --- but I couldn't find anything on the web that let you do what I wanted. 

So I went ahead and made my own. You can find the shiny app [here](https://ornstein.shinyapps.io/Draw-A-Sample/), or see it embedded below:

```{r embed shiny, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://ornstein.shinyapps.io/Draw-A-Sample/", height = "800px")
