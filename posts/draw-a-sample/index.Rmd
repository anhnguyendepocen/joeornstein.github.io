I wanted to let my students play around with drawing a random sample from a population --- so that they could explore ideas like the Central Limit Theorem, how often a certain low-prevalence virus will show up in a randomly drawn class of size $N$, etc. And I was surprised that I couldn't find a basic web app that let you do what I wanted, so I went ahead and made one.

You can find the shiny app [here](), or see it embedded below:
