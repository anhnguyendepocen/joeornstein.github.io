Putting together some lectures on calculus for my graduate students reminded of James Gleick's [excellent biography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17098.Isaac_Newton) of Isaac Newton. Prior to reading, my impression of Newton was that he was some jerk who was lucky to live in the 16th century, when you could be knighted as a towering genius for picking a lot of low-hanging intellectual fruit. You know. Objects fall because of gravity. Prisms defract light. Stuff like that.

One of the things I loved about the book is how well it puts you into a pre-Newtonian mindset, which make his achievements all the more impressive.

Consider what your theory of gravity would be if you had never been taught Newton's laws. .... I ran the experiment to find out, asking my four-year-old why clouds float and apples fall down. I quote her response in full:

> Because

TODO: Ask Fiona why clouds float and apples fall.
