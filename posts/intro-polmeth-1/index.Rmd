My first-semester graduate political methodology course is a practical introduction to working with data. We'll cover the most useful mathematical and computational tools that one needs to function as an academic political scientist, including: 

 - Data Wrangling
 - Data Visualization
 - Reproducible Research
 - Optimization
 - Matrix Algebra
 - Probability and Inference

In Week 1, we discuss the fundamentals of `R`, functions, vectors, matrices, and summary statistics. The slides are [here]().
