Ornstein, Joseph T. "Municipal Election Timing and the Politics of Urban Growth" *Working Paper*.

- [PDF](papers/Ornstein-ElectionTiming.pdf)

## Overview

Many wealthy coastal cities in the United States are suffering from acute housing shortages, brought on by restrictive zoning policies that prohibit the construction of new housing. This paper investigates how the timing of municipal elections affects the land use policy decisions of city councils. Because the electorate in off-cycle elections consists disproportionately of homeowners, senior citizens and other groups opposed to new housing, cities that hold their elections off-cycle tend to issue fewer new building permits and have higher home prices.

## Ballot Initiatives

A large number of California cities require that significant land use and zoning decisions be put before the voters in a ballot initiative. The data from these ballot measures provide a useful window into the preferences of voters, and how these preferences change with election timing. As the following figure illustrates, when ballot initiatives to approve new infill housing construction are held off-cycle, they receive about 10 percentage points less support on average than those held on-cycle.

## Empirical Analysis

My dataset combines information on election timing, building permits, home values, and demography from over 300 cities in California. In both cross-sectional and difference-in-difference analyses, I find that cities with off-cycle elections issued fewer new building permits than similar cities with on-cycle elections:

As a consequence, these cities have grown more expensive over time:
